Homework - Week 1 - Code Refactor

March 2020

Code for the Horiseon website was cleaned up. The links are functioning to navigate to the respective sections at the bottom. The CSS is consolidated so there is no repeating CSS rules for sections. Comments were added to label and easily identify sections. Alt tags were added to all image tags and a descriptive title for the webpage was added.
